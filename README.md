# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your keys:

   ```env
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
   FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
   FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
   GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_google_places_api_key
   EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

   EXPO_PUBLIC_TRAVELPAYOUTS_MARKER=your_travelpayouts_marker
   EXPO_PUBLIC_TRAVELPAYOUTS_TOKEN=your_travelpayouts_token
   ```

   The `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` should be the same key with the Places and Maps APIs enabled for search and photos.
   The `GEMINI_API_KEY` powers AI trip generation.

   The Travelpayouts marker and token enable affiliate links and API access for flights, hotels, and activities. Affiliate links are generated with program-specific `tp.media` URLs (Aviasales for flights, Hotellook for hotels, Welcome Pickups for tours and transfers, and Searadar for cruises) to avoid 404 errors.

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
